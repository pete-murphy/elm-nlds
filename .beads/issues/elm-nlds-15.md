## Description

Add proper attribution to the original Unison libraries this package is ported from:

- `pchiusano/nlds` - Natural Language Disambiguator
- `pchiusano/peachy` - Priority search data structure

Include in:
1. README - mention this is an Elm port of the Unison libraries
2. Module doc comments - credit Paul Chiusano
3. CHANGELOG - note the Unison origins in 1.0.0 release notes

This maintains good open source etiquette and helps users find the original implementations if they're interested.
