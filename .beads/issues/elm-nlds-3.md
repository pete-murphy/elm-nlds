# Write Design Goals section in README

- **ID:** elm-nlds-3
- **Type:** task
- **Status:** closed
- **Priority:** 2 (medium)
- **Created:** 2026-02-02

## Description

Write an explicit Design Goals section for the README that explains:

1. What differentiates this package from other parsers
2. The core philosophy (natural language parsing, order-independence, lazy prioritized results)
3. What problems it solves and what it intentionally doesn't solve

This helps users quickly determine if the library is a good fit for their needs and frames feature request discussions constructively.
